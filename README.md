# Geomagnetic_IPS_using_RNN

POSTECH CSED499II Research Project II

The goal of this project is to improve the performance of indoor positioning system using geomagnetic field by applying recurrent neural network to the localizing step.
The program to collect magnetic field data for a magnetic map can be found at https://github.com/HyekyoungKim/DataCollectionManualTag.
